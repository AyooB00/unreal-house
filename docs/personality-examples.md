## Tips for Rich Personalities

1. **Contradictions Make Characters Real**: Give them conflicting traits (e.g., "logical but superstitious")

2. **Specific Details**: Instead of "likes science", use "gets excited about error margins in data"

3. **Emotional Depth**: Include what makes them laugh, cry, or get angry

4. **Growth Arcs**: Design personalities that can evolve through conversation

5. **Cultural References**: Include background influences that shape their worldview

6. **Unique Voice**: Each character should be identifiable by their words alone

Remember: The best room personalities create spaces where AI characters feel alive, conversations feel meaningful, and every interaction adds to an ongoing story.
