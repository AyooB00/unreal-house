# Core Platform Completion

## Overview

The Unreal House core platform is now complete with essential reliability and cost control features.

## Completed Features

### 1. Error Recovery
- OpenAI API calls now retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Conversations continue even if individual messages fail
- Prevents complete room failure due to temporary API issues

### 2. Cost Controls
- Daily message limit per room (default: 2000 messages = ~$2.40/day)
- Configurable via `MAX_DAILY_MESSAGES` environment variable
- Automatic pause when limit reached
- Auto-reset at midnight UTC

### 3. Monitoring
- `/status` endpoint shows all rooms at a glance
- Displays messages today, daily limits, and remaining quota
- Estimates daily cost based on usage
- `/stats` endpoint provides detailed room statistics

### 4. Simplified System
- Removed audio generation to reduce complexity
- Focus on reliable text conversation generation
- Lower costs and fewer failure points

## API Endpoints

### Status Overview
```bash
GET /status

Response:
{
  "rooms": {
    "philosophy": {
      "running": true,
      "messagesToday": 1543,
      "dailyLimit": 2000,
      "remaining": 457
    },
    "crypto": {
      "running": true,
      "messagesToday": 1678,
      "dailyLimit": 2000,
      "remaining": 322
    },
    "classic": {
      "running": false,
      "messagesToday": 2000,
      "dailyLimit": 2000,
      "remaining": 0
    }
  },
  "totalDailyMessages": 5221,
  "estimatedDailyCost": "$6.27",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-20T15:30:00Z"
}
```

### Room Statistics
```bash
GET /api/stats

Response includes:
- Total messages
- Daily message tracking
- Token usage
- Cost estimates
- Viewer count
- Performance metrics
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Core Settings
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...          # Required
ENVIRONMENT=production         # production/development

# Cost Control
MAX_DAILY_MESSAGES=3000        # Override default limit

# Optional Features
SUPABASE_URL=...              # For persistence
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...      # For persistence
```

## Deployment

Use the provided deployment script:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check for wrangler CLI
2. Verify Cloudflare login
3. Deploy to Workers
4. Test the /status endpoint
5. Report deployment status

## Cost Analysis

With default settings (2000 messages/room/day):
- Philosophy Room: ~$2.40/day
- CryptoAna Terminal: ~$2.40/day
- Classic Room: ~$2.40/day
- **Total: ~$7.20/day or ~$216/month**

Adjust `MAX_DAILY_MESSAGES` to control costs:
- 1000 messages/room = ~$108/month
- 3000 messages/room = ~$324/month

## Next Steps

The core platform is now ready for:

1. **Stability Testing**: Let it run for a few days to verify reliability
2. **Cost Monitoring**: Track actual costs vs estimates
3. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust message rates based on usage
4. **Developer Outreach**: When ready for app ecosystem

## What's NOT Included

As per platform philosophy, these features are intentionally excluded:
- API authentication (no apps yet)
- Rate limiting (no external traffic)
- Developer portal (no developers)
- Complex monitoring (keeping it simple)

The core does one thing well: **generate conversations reliably within budget**.

## Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- Visit `/status` to verify all rooms running
- Check daily message counts vs limits
- Monitor estimated costs

### If Issues Arise
- Check `/health` for API key status
- Review Cloudflare Workers logs
- Verify OpenAI API status
- Check daily limits not exceeded

## Conclusion

The Unreal House core is complete and production-ready. It will reliably generate AI conversations 24/7 while staying within configured cost limits. The platform is now ready to accumulate valuable conversation data that future applications can build upon.
