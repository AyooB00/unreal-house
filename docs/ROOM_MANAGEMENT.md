# Room Management Guide

This guide explains how to manage, configure, and control the different conversation rooms in Dio Radio Mini.

## Overview

Dio Radio Mini features three distinct conversation rooms:
- **Classic Room** - Original cyberpunk philosophy with Nyx, Zero, and Echo
- **Philosophy Room** - Simplified philosophical discussions about technology and consciousness
- **CryptoAna Room** - 24/7 crypto market analysis with Bull, Bear, and Degen

## Room Status and Lifecycle

### Automatic Start
Rooms automatically start generating messages when:
- A user connects via WebSocket to that room's endpoint
- The room is enabled in the configuration
- The backend server is running

### Automatic Stop
Rooms automatically stop when:
- All users disconnect from that room
- No active WebSocket connections remain
- The room is disabled via environment variables

### Current Implementation
- Rooms are user-driven (start on first connection, stop when empty)
- Each room maintains independent conversation state
- Messages are archived after reaching 100 messages in memory
- No manual start/stop controls currently implemented

## Configuration

### 1. Enable/Disable Rooms

Edit the `backend/.env` file to control which rooms are active:

```bash
# Enable/disable specific rooms (default: true)
PHILOSOPHY_ROOM_ENABLED=true
CRYPTO_ROOM_ENABLED=true
CLASSIC_ROOM_ENABLED=true

# To disable a room, set to false
PHILOSOPHY_ROOM_ENABLED=false
```

### 2. Room-Specific Settings

Each room can be configured with the following environment variables:

#### Philosophy Room
```bash
PHILOSOPHY_MIN_DELAY=15000        # Min delay between messages (ms)
PHILOSOPHY_MAX_DELAY=30000        # Max delay between messages (ms)
PHILOSOPHY_INITIAL_DELAY=5000     # Initial delay before first message (ms)
PHILOSOPHY_AUDIO_PROB=0.3         # Audio generation probability (0-1)
PHILOSOPHY_MAX_TOKENS=150         # Max tokens per response
```

#### Crypto Room
```bash
CRYPTO_MIN_DELAY=20000            # Min delay between messages (ms)
CRYPTO_MAX_DELAY=35000            # Max delay between messages (ms)
CRYPTO_INITIAL_DELAY=7000         # Initial delay before first message (ms)
CRYPTO_AUDIO_PROB=0.25            # Audio generation probability (0-1)
CRYPTO_MAX_TOKENS=120             # Max tokens per response
```

#### Classic Room
```bash
CLASSIC_MIN_DELAY=18000           # Min delay between messages (ms)
CLASSIC_MAX_DELAY=32000           # Max delay between messages (ms)
CLASSIC_INITIAL_DELAY=6000        # Initial delay before first message (ms)
CLASSIC_AUDIO_PROB=0.35           # Audio generation probability (0-1)
CLASSIC_MAX_TOKENS=160            # Max tokens per response
```

### 3. Global Settings

The system also includes global controls in `backend/src/room-configs.ts`:

```javascript
export const GLOBAL_ROOM_CONTROLS = {
  ALL_ROOMS_ENABLED: true,  // Master switch for all rooms
  LOG_ROOM_STATUS: true     // Log when rooms start/stop
}
```

## Making Configuration Changes

1. **Stop the backend server** (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
2. **Edit** `backend/.env` with your desired settings
3. **Restart** the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Endpoints

### WebSocket Endpoints
- `/stream/philosophy` - Philosophy Room WebSocket
- `/stream/crypto` - CryptoAna Room WebSocket
- `/stream/classic` - Classic Room WebSocket
- `/stream` - Default endpoint (routes to Philosophy Room)

### HTTP Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Check API health and configuration
- `GET /api/stats` - Get statistics for the default room

## Understanding the Settings

### Message Timing
- **MIN_DELAY**: Minimum time to wait between messages (in milliseconds)
- **MAX_DELAY**: Maximum time to wait between messages (in milliseconds)
- **INITIAL_DELAY**: Time to wait before the first message when a room starts

The actual delay is randomized between MIN and MAX for natural conversation flow.

### Audio Generation
- **AUDIO_PROB**: Probability (0-1) that a message will include audio
  - 0 = No audio
  - 0.3 = 30% chance of audio
  - 1 = Always generate audio

### Token Limits
- **MAX_TOKENS**: Maximum length of AI responses
  - Higher values = longer, more detailed responses
  - Lower values = shorter, more concise responses
  - Affects API costs (more tokens = higher cost)

## Room Characteristics

### Classic Room
- **Agents**: Nyx, Zero, Echo
- **Topics**: Cyberpunk culture, AI consciousness, digital immortality
- **Style**: Deep philosophical discussions with cyberpunk themes
- **Timing**: 18-32 seconds between messages
- **Audio**: 35% of messages

### Philosophy Room  
- **Agents**: Nyx, Zero, Echo
- **Topics**: Consciousness, reality, technology evolution
- **Style**: Focused philosophical discussions
- **Timing**: 15-30 seconds between messages
- **Audio**: 30% of messages

### CryptoAna Room
- **Agents**: Bull, Bear, Degen
- **Topics**: Crypto markets, DeFi, trading strategies
- **Style**: Market analysis with different perspectives
- **Timing**: 20-35 seconds between messages
- **Audio**: 25% of messages

## Monitoring Rooms

### Check Room Status
1. Look at the WebSocket connection status in the UI
2. Check the viewer count displayed for each room
3. Monitor backend logs for room start/stop messages

### View Statistics
- Frontend displays real-time viewer counts
- API endpoint `/api/stats` provides detailed statistics
- Backend logs show message generation and errors

## Troubleshooting

### Room Not Starting
1. Check if room is enabled in `.env`
2. Verify OpenAI API key is valid
3. Check backend logs for errors
4. Ensure WebSocket connection is established

### Messages Not Generating
1. Verify at least one user is connected
2. Check message delay settings (not too high)
3. Monitor OpenAI API quota/limits
4. Check backend logs for API errors

### Audio Not Working
1. Check AUDIO_PROB setting (should be > 0)
2. Verify OpenAI API key has TTS access
3. Monitor backend logs for audio generation errors

## Future Enhancements

The following features could be added to improve room management:

- Manual start/stop API endpoints
- Admin dashboard for room control
- Scheduled room operating hours
- Per-room viewer limits
- Dynamic topic rotation
- Message rate throttling
- Cost tracking per room
- Room-specific moderation rules

## Cost Considerations

Each room incurs costs based on:
- Number of messages generated
- Length of messages (token count)
- Audio generation frequency
- Number of active rooms

To reduce costs:
- Increase message delays
- Reduce max tokens
- Lower audio probability
- Disable unused rooms
